## Hello, I'm Lance ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal website and coding playground at [twob.dev](https://twob.dev).

## What's This Project?

This is my journey into building a web application "the hard way" - deliberately avoiding major frontend frameworks while exploring web standards and modern JavaScript/TypeScript.

I'm using:

- **Backend**: Laravel as a simple API server
- **Frontend**: Pure TypeScript with no major frameworks
- **Goal**: Learn by doing and understand what happens under the hood

I initially considered just using vanilla JavaScript, but I like typed programming languages too much - TypeScript's type system helps me catch errors early and makes the development experience more enjoyable.

### My Minimal Toolset

In keeping with the "learn by doing" approach, I'm using only a few essential tools:

- **Rsbuild**: For bundling with minimal configuration
- **Biome**: For linting and formatting
- **Laravel**: For the backend API
- **Deno**: For TypeScript runtime and development utilities
- **VS Code**: As my development environment

#### Why Laravel?

I chose Laravel over lighter alternatives like Hono or Express simply because I want to learn it. While a minimal JavaScript/TypeScript API framework would align more with the frontend's "from scratch" philosophy, Laravel provides an opportunity to explore a mature, full-featured backend framework. This creates an interesting contrast: building from first principles on the frontend while learning best practices from an opinionated framework on the backend.

## Why Build This?

I wanted to understand what's happening beneath the abstractions of popular frameworks. By building my own micro-framework and working directly with web standards, I'm learning:

- How the browser's native APIs work
- Building UI components from scratch
- State management without external libraries
- The real challenges frameworks solve

## Project Philosophy

> "To truly understand something, try building it yourself."

This is explicitly _not_ meant to be a production-ready framework or the "right way" to build websites. It's my personal sandbox for learning web development fundamentals through experimentation.
